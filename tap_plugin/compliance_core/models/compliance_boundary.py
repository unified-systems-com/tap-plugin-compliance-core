    """An authorization boundary — the perimeter of a single authorization.

    A boundary names the set of system components in scope for a single
    compliance authorization (a FedRAMP ATO, a SOC2 audit scope, an ISO
    certification scope, …). Components are linked to their boundary by the
    ``SCOPED_TO_COMPLIANCE_BOUNDARY`` edge (component → boundary). "Identify
    everything inside the boundary" is then a fan-in query over that edge.

    Regime-agnostic substrate: the scoping concept is shared across regimes;
    the regime is layered per-instance, not baked into the model.

    The initial pass carries only name and description; structured metadata
    (impact level, authorization dates, authorizing official) becomes typed
    fields when a consumer needs them rather than a speculative JSON blob now.

    Identity (`req-compliance-core-identity`): found again by the producer that declared it
    and that producer's own key — `("source", "source_key")`. A producer that writes neither
    gets a fresh node every run rather than an error, so writing them is the data contract a
    minting plugin owes this one.

    # authorization is an external object (an ATO package, an audit scope) held in someone
    # else's system; that system's reference for it is the stable handle. `name` was considered

    # fork one boundary into two the first time that happened (Issue# 8 -
