    """A finding is the bridge between an asset in the graph and a compliance requirement.

    v1 shape is deliberately minimal: name, description, status. Lifecycle events
    (being granted an exception, being resolved) are modeled as separate entities
    connected by edges — not as fields on the finding. Exception coverage is a
    graph-relational fact expressed via `COVERS_COMPLIANCE_FINDING` edges and queried
    via traversal; it does not project onto `status`.

    Regime-agnostic substrate: a finding is a finding under any regime (FedRAMP,
    SOC2, CMMC, ISO). The regime is layered per-instance, not baked into the model.

    Identity (`req-compliance-core-identity`): a finding is found again by the producer
    that asserted it and the key that producer uses — `("source", "source_key")`. That is
    the data contract a minting plugin owes this one: a producer that writes neither field
    gets a FRESH node on every run rather than an error, because a search over holes is
    honestly "not found" rather than a match on nothing.
